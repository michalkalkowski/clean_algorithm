This is an implementation of the CLEAN algorithm which identifies individual
waveforms in a multi-component signal by simple spectral summations.

Two functions are provided. `extract_CLEAN` performs the iterative search and
identifies individual components (wave packets) present in the measured signal.
`plot_components` can be used to visualise the outcome of `extract_CLEAN`.

    """
    Applies the CLEAN algorithm to extract individual components from a multi-
    component signal. The algorithm is based in the assumption that the
    measured signal is a sum of scaled, delayed and shifted copies of
    the original signal.

    Individual components are extracted by iterating over dominant components
    of the spectrum. The algorithms starts from taking the spectrum of the
    input signal as a starting residue. It determines the amplitude, phase
    and time delay of the dominant component and subtracts the reconstructed
    spectrum of this componend from the residue. A new residue is formed,
    and the search for the dominant component restarts.

    The loop is terminated after the amplitude associated with one individual
    component drops below a given threshold.

    It is assumed that both the original and the measured signals are sampled
    at the same rate.
